# Lab 02: Creating Fabric Data Agent and Publish to Teams

## Estimated Duration: 120 Minutes

## 🎯 Lab Scenario

Contoso Retail wants to modernize its data platform by building a **unified and governed analytics foundation using Microsoft Fabric**. The organization needs to consolidate customer, product, and sales data from multiple systems to enable efficient data processing, reporting, and business analysis.

In this hands-on lab, you will work with **Microsoft Fabric** components to explore and manage unified enterprise data, process data through lakehouse architecture layers, and enable analytical reporting for business users and sales analysts.

## 📖 Lab Overview

In this lab, you will design a **Microsoft Fabric Data Agent** connected to a **Lakehouse** to support natural language queries on structured data. You will also create a custom AI agent in **Microsoft Copilot Studio**, connect it to the Fabric data agent, configure authentication and orchestration options, and publish the agent to **Microsoft Teams** so users can ask business questions and receive data-driven answers.

## 🎯 Lab Objectives

You will be able to complete the following tasks:

- **Task 1**: Create and Configure a Microsoft Fabric Data Agent
- **Task 2**: Implement and Validate an End-to-End Copilot Agent with Fabric Data Agent Integration

## Task 1: Create and Configure a Microsoft Fabric Data Agent

In this task, you will create and publish a Microsoft Fabric Data Agent within an existing Fabric workspace. You will connect the agent to a Lakehouse data source, select the required tables, add a descriptive prompt, and publish the agent so it can answer natural language questions based on the connected data.

1. Navigate back to **Microsoft Fabric** portal.

1. To create a new Fabric data agent, first navigate to **fabric<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/> (1)** workspace created in previous lab, and then click on **+ New Item (2)** button. In the **All items** tab, search for **data agent (3)** to locate the appropriate option, then click on **Data agent (4)**

    ![quota-check-output](../Images/L2T1S9.png)

1. Here are the few examples of prompts that you can try giving to the **Data Agent**.

    ```
    Provide me the total number of customers.
    ```

    ![quota-check-output](../Images/L2T1S10.png)

1. Try one more prompt to validate the agent's response.

    ```
