# Chat with your data Fabric

## Overall Estimated Duration: 4 Hours

## 📘 Workshop Scenario

**Contoso Retail** is experiencing challenges in analyzing customer and sales performance data spread across multiple disconnected systems. **Sales analysts**, currently spend significant time collecting, consolidating, and validating data before meaningful insights can be generated.

To address this challenge, the organization implements the **Agentic Applications for Unified Data Foundation Solution Accelerator using Microsoft Fabric** and **Azure AI Foundry**. The solution unifies enterprise data into a governed data foundation and enables AI-powered agents to interact with business data using natural language queries.

Using the solution, analysts can:

* Query enterprise sales data conversationally.
* Identify top-performing products and customer segments.
* Analyze revenue growth trends across demographics.
* Generate contextual business insights faster.
* Reduce dependency on manual data consolidation.


## 📖 Overview

In this **Chat with your data Fabric** hands-on lab, you will explore how to design and deploy agentic **AI applications using Microsoft’s Unified Data Foundation (UDF)** solution accelerator. The lab guides you through combining Microsoft Fabric, Azure AI, containerized microservices, and orchestration workflows to build intelligent, production-ready agentic solutions.

By the end of the workshop, you will gain a clear understanding of how structured data, enterprise analytics, and LLM-powered agents come together to enable next-generation enterprise applications.

## 🎯 Objectives

- **Building and Deploying a Fabric-Integrated AI Application on Azure :** In this hands-on lab, participants will provision and configure Microsoft Fabric for Copilot and data agents, deploy Azure infrastructure using Bicep and Azure Developer CLI, set up application authentication, and validate an end-to-end solution by querying and visualizing data through natural language interactions.

- **Creating Fabric Data Agent and Publish to Teams :** In this hands-on lab, participants will learn how to create a Microsoft Fabric Data Agent connected to a Lakehouse, build and configure a custom AI agent in Microsoft Copilot Studio, integrate both agents, and publish the solution to Microsoft Teams to enable natural language, data-driven business insights.


## ⚙️ Prerequisites

Participants should have:

- A basic understanding of Microsoft Azure and resource groups
- Familiarity with Microsoft Fabric, especially workspaces, capacities, and Lakehouse concepts
- Awareness of Copilot and AI features in Microsoft Fabric, including data agents and natural language querying
- Basic knowledge of command-line tools, including Azure CLI and Azure Developer CLI (azd)
- Familiarity with GitHub and GitHub Codespaces for source control and cloud-based development environments

## 🏗️ Architecture

This lab showcases an end-to-end agentic AI solution using **Microsoft Fabric** and **Copilot Studio** for conversational data insights. Enterprise data is stored in OneLake and exposed through a Fabric SQL Database, enabling a Fabric Data Agent for governed access. The agent is integrated with Copilot Studio to deliver insights via Microsoft Teams, while a custom agent backend using Azure App Service and Microsoft Agent Framework supports web-based interactions. This architecture demonstrates secure, scalable, multi-channel AI-driven analytics.

## ⚙️ Explanation of Core Components

- **Microsoft Fabric**:  Serves as the unified data platform for storing, managing, and analyzing enterprise data.

- **OneLake(unified data foundation)**: Provides centralized storage for transaction, product, and customer data.

- **SQL Database in Fabric**: Stores structured business data used for reporting and AI-driven analysis.

- **Fabric Data Agent / AI Agents**: Enables users to interact with enterprise data using natural language queries.

- **Microsoft Copilot Studio / Microsoft Foundry**: Used to create, configure, and manage AI-powered copilots and agents.

- **API App Service**: Handles communication between the web application and backend AI services.

- **Microsoft Agent Framework**: Coordinates agent workflows and orchestration between connected services.

- **Container Registry**: Stores container images required for application deployment.

- **App Service**: Hosts the application backend and supporting services.

- **Web Front-End**: Provides the user interface for exploring insights and interacting with the solution.

- **Microsoft Teams**: Allows users to access copilots and enterprise insights directly from Teams.
