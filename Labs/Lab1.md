    ![](../Images/lab1-31.png)

1. Now that the bash script is executed, through this script you have automated the AI agent setup process by validating Azure access, assigning the required Azure AI permissions, creating the AI agents, and updating the App Service configuration with the generated agent details.

1. Run the bash script from the output of the azd deployment. Replace the **fabric-workspaceId** with your Fabric workspace Id created in the **Task 1 Step 13**. The script will look like the following:

    ```Shell
    bash ./infra/scripts/fabric_scripts/run_fabric_items_scripts.sh <fabric-workspaceId>
    ```

1. Upon successful execution of the script, the resulting output will appear as shown below. Now that the command is executed successfully, it configures and deploys the required **Microsoft Fabric** resources by creating Fabric items, generating SQL connection details, and updating the App Service configuration with the Fabric database settings required for the solution.

    ![](../Images/jan2026-chat-fabric-6.png)

1. If you want to switch the **backendRuntimeStack** (for example, from **Python to .NET or vice versa**), or switch the previously used **use case** (from **Retail-sales-analysis to Insurance-improve-customer-meetings or vice versa**), you must first run the two cleanup commands. After cleanup, repeat the steps starting from Task 3, Step 21.

    ```Shell
    azd down
    ```

    ```Shell
    rm -rf .azure
    ```
